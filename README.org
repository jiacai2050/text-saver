A browser extension to save texts anytime, anywhere.

When I read issues/pulls of my favorite projects, I always learn something new,
and often there are comments I think are worth digging further, but GitHub has no =SAVE= button for single issue/pull, not to mention specific comment, so I create =Text Saver= to fix this.

When click =Add to Text Saver= in context menu, current text selection will be saved if there is any, otherwise URL of current tab will be saved.

All saved texts can be viewed in option page, and users can export their saved texts to local disk.
